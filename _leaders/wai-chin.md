**Wai-Chin Matsuoka** is Singaporean Chinese, who was transplanted to the U.S.A.
39 years ago when she came to do her graduate studies, and met her
American-Japanese husband.

She’s a spiritual director who comes alive whenever there’s an opportunity to
midwife what’s ready to be birthed.
She’s particularly experienced in bringing forth new life from the ashes of
change and transition.
Mentored and credentialed as an Ensoulment Coach, and a certified InterPlay
leader, Wai-Chin loves to weave spirituality, somatic practices, soul-tending
and InterPlay tools and forms into a tapestry of Love and Play.
She especially enjoys shaping these tapestries into retreats, ongoing Body
Wisdom Playgroup, and soul care workshops specifically for social reform
activists.
