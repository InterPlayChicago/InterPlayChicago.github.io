Once while I was swing dancing to a live band, I suddenly noticed that the music
seemed to be following my how I danced.
I looked up in surprise at the upright bassist. He knowingly smiled at me.

We're going to play with ways of following the music of the band (and each
other).
And the band is going to try to respond in kind to how we moving.
