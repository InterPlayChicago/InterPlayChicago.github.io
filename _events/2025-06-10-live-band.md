Once while I was swing dancing to a live band, I suddenly noticed that the music
seemed to be following my dancing.
I looked at the upright bassist with curiosity. He knowingly smiled at me.
My dancing was inspiring how he was playing!

We're going to play with ways of following the music of the band (and each
other).
**And helping the band connect with us and how we are moving.**
