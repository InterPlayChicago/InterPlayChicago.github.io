towards more, for example:

- Offer scholarships to local InterPlayers to attend the 2025 Leaders
Gathering, Art and Social Change, and InterPlay Chicago offerings.
- Continue to fund administrator stipends to manage digital outreach,
accounting, and programming.
- Offer online & on-site classes that uplift local leaders, develop partnerships
and expand our outreach
- Fund leader stipends, scholarships and space rental for innovative programming
- Provide tuition assistance for local leaders who are interested in pursuing
the Life Practice Program and/or the Leader Training Program.
- Bring in seasoned InterPlay leaders to offer Untensives.

Please consider supporting more empowered play in the world!
