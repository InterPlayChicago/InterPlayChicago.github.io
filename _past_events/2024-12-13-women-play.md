2nd Friday of the month

WomenPlay is grounded in the practices and tools of InterPlay.  These
experiential practices or “forms” help us to unite body, mind, heart and spirit
through creative expressive forms of movement, voice, story, connection and
stillness.

InterPlay tools such as the Physicality of Grace or Easy Focus help us to
integrate the gifts of embodiment into our daily lives.  By playing creatively
with universal themes, we can more fully discover what practices work best for
us and often find deeper connections to spirit.

With the support of community, we are accepted for who we are and honored for
the inherent wisdom within each of us.
