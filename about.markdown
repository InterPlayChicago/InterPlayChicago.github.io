# What is InterPlay?

InterPlay is based on a series of easy, fun and engaging incremental "forms" or
ways of interacting with each other that lead participants to movement, telling
their own stories, and to song.  Firmly based in affirmation and looking for the
good.  InterPlay offers a pathway for self discovery.  Each person decides how
much or how little to do based on their own comfort level.

**InterPlay** celebrates the creativity in every one of us and reignites the
playful parts of ourselves.  We learn to expand our personal awareness and grow
our powers of noticing and of bearing witness.  InterPlay explores the language
of play in a deep and powerful way.

**InterPlay** is a community of people around the world who speak the shared
language of body wisdom, creativity and play.  InterPlay practices help build
communities and relationships that live and flourish in everyday life.  It
offers learning in personal and team dynamics, leadership and personal
potential.

**InterPlay** is used by leaders in community outreach with homeless shelters,
retirement facilities, prisons, churches, therapy and much more.

**InterPlay** was founded by Cynthia Winton-Henry and Phil Porter more than
thirty years ago and has spread around the world becoming a **community of
people around the world** who speak the shared language of play.
